Form Terms
==========

 - Application

    A form or a series of forms that satisfies a business function.

 - Base table

    The database table on which a block is based.

 - Base table field

    A field that corresponds to a column in the base table
    of the block that owned the field.

 - Block

    A logical collection of fields in a form. A block can
    correspond to one table in the database or to no table.

 - Constant text

    Text that appears in a form time it is run.

 - Context

    A concept that you can use to determine what parts of a
    form you can currently access from within the interface.

 - Designer

    An application developer or programmer who uses
    **formax** to create and modigy forms.

 - Field

    An area on a page that can display data and accept
    operator input. The data that they display can
    correspond to data from a column in a database table.

 - Form

    A logical collection of blocks, fields and triggers.

 - Form database

    A sqlite-database containing all the objects that make
    up the form.

 - Multi-record block

    A block that can display more than one record at a time.

 - Object

    A group of data, such as a form, block, field or trigger.

 - Operator

    An end-user of a **formax** application.

 - Page

    A collection of display information. Similar in concept
    to a slide Projection, a page displays fields and
    constant text to operators on their computer or terminal
    screen when they execute a form.

 - Pop-up window

    A **formax** object that overlays an area of the current
    display. The form displays a pop-up window in response
    to some event or user action.

 - Record

    Data from one row in a database table or view, as
    presented in a form.

 - Scope

    The domain, or range, in which a trigger operates. This
    domain is determined by the level (form, block, or field)
    at which you define the trigger.

 - Single-record block

    A block that can display only one record at a time.

 - Trigger

    A piece of logic that is executed at, or "tiggered" by,
    a form event.

Database Terms
==============

 - Column

    In a database table, a "vertical" group of cells that
    represent one kind of data.

 - Constraint

    A rule or restriction concerning a piece of data that is
    enforced at the data level, rather than the object or
    application level.

 - Database

    A collection of tables controlled by one data dictionary.

 - Foreign key

    A value or column in one table that refers to a primary
    key in another table.

 - Index

    An optional structure associated with a table that is
    used by the database software to locate rows of the
    table quickly, and optionally to guarantee that every
    row is unique.

 - Lock

    A restriction that assigns temporary ownership, or
    control, of a database resource (table or row) to a
    user. A lock can prevent other users from changing data
    that a user is updating.

 - Primary key

    Information used to identify a row in a table. Also
    known as a key.

 - Row

    In a database table, a "horizontal" group of column
    values.

 - Table

    The basic unit of information in a relational database
    management system. A table is a two dimensional grid
    that is made up of rows and columns.

 - Transaction

    A logical unit of work. Specifically, a transaction is
    the group of events that occurs between the data changes
    and the user commiting them.
